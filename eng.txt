Children's joyful shouts echo across the school playground during recess. Kids chase each other across the grass, their colorful backpacks scattered nearby. Some cluster around swing sets, taking turns pushing each other higher. Teachers watch fondly from benches while small groups play hopscotch and tag. The entire area radiates pure, unrestrained childhood energy and laughter beneath the warm midday sun.
